Need to share some files, or a screen? Want to manage a printer via its web interface? Maybe even check out that website your colleague is working on. Coucou makes it super easy to perform these tasks.

Coucou did all that and it also gave you a nice overview of which devices (and their owners) are currently present on the network.
