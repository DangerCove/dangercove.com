We took a little time coding up scripts for some popular Dutch websites! Download the scripts below to add support for:

- Uitzending Gemist
- Skoften.net
- Flabber.nl
- Fail.nl

To install the scripts:

- Download and install <a href="/airtube">AirTube</a>;
- <a href="http://download.dangercove.com/airtube/scripts/dutch.zip">Download the zip</a> and extract it;
- Select all the .lua files;
- Drag them onto AirTube's dock icon;
- Surf to one of the sites mentioned above and try streaming.
