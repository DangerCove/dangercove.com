      <h3>Play Web Videos you find online on your Apple TV, instantly!</h3>
      <p>AirTube lets you stream that awesome talk on Vimeo that was just mentioned on Twitter to your Apple TV. Without having to go through menus or grabbing your phone/tablet.</p>
      <p>We tested AirTube to work with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>YouTube</li>
        <li>Vimeo</li>
        <li>TED</li>
        <li>Funny or Die</li>
        <li>Metacafe</li>
        <li>The Onion</li>
        <li>Daily Motion</li>
        <li>CBS News</li>
        <li>Fox News</li>
        <li>Direct web links to MP4 videos</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And a few others, thanks to the <a href="http://quvi.sourceforge.com" target="_blank">quvi project</a>, including some that might be a little "Less Suitable For Work", if you know what we mean. We obviously did not include those with the app, but you can <a href="{{ page.url | remove:'index.html' | strip_slash }}/nsfw">get them here</a>.</p>
      <p><em>Notice: we depend on the sites mentioned above to keep providing MP4 videos that work with your Apple TV. Changes to supported websites might stop some videos from working. Check for updates in the app, or on our website when that happens.</em></p>

      <h3>Simply Drag & Drop</h3>
      <p>With AirTube instead of clicking the link to the video, you just drag the link from your browser onto the AirTube dock icon and you're set!</p>
      <p>We're working on a set of browser plugins that will make it even easier to start streaming.</p>

      <h3>Release Notes</h3>
      <p>We're releasing AirTube as a beta. This means the app is fully functional, ready to use and will do what it says here on the page, but contains a few quirks that we're ironing out before we call it v1.0.0:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can't scrub/seek in Vimeo video's from your Mac. It will work fine with your Apple TV remote however;</li>
        <li>Not every site in libquvi's library works with AirTube;</li>
        <li>Sometimes the video will keep playing when you close the window. Use your Apple TV remote, drag another video onto AirTube or quit the app to stop the video on your Apple TV.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the plus-side, you can get the app for about <strong>half the price</strong> of version 1.0.0!</p>
