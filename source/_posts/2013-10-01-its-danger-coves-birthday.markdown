I'm writing this from my studio in The Hague. It's been quite an adventure from 
when Danger Cove started October first 2011. An expedition that delivered [four
released apps](http://www.dangercove.com), one in progress (more on that in a 
future post) and a whole bunch of projects that looked cool at first, but now live in a folder called "shelved" ;).

It feels awesome that Danger Cove apps are being used by more people than I could
hope for. Thanks so much to the wonderful people that took the time to spread 
the word about them. I appreciate it a lot.

To celebrate, both [Porthole](http://www.getporthole.com) and 
[AirVLC](http://www.dangercove.com/airvlc) are 40% off today! I assume you 
already got that from the header image though. The offer will end October
2nd at 12pm CET.
