For those of you that are familiar with <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a>,
you probably need no explanation as to why a workflow for [Reign](/reign) will come in 
pretty handy. Read on to learn what it does.

> Alfred saves you time when you search for files online or on your Mac. Be more productive with hotkeys, keywords and file actions at your fingertips.

That's what it says on Alfred's website. It basically moves a lot of control to
your keyboard, so you can keep your eyes on the task at hand. For Reign this
means that you can remote control Spotify running on another Mac by simply
entering simple commands, like ```reign n``` to skip a track or ```reign o```
to open the track that's currently playing in your own Spotify client, so you
can star or share it.

It reduces the need to visit the web interface and makes remote controlling
Spotify even faster and easier!

Of course, like Reign, the workflow is open-source and free to share. [Visit
the GitHub project](https://github.com/DangerCove/reign-alfred2-workflow) to contribute and read more about how it works. Or
just [download the workflow file](https://raw.github.com/DangerCove/reign-alfred2-workflow/master/Reign%20for%20Spotify.alfredworkflow)
to get started.

Reign is available on the Mac App Store, for free.
