I just released Porthole v1.4.4 which restores compatibility with the Apple TV.
Apple's latest update for the little black device changed some AirPlay protocol
related things that stopped quite a few third-party AirPlay audio apps to work.
The update makes sure Porthole plays by the new rules.

<!-- more -->

Putting out a fix came sooner than expected, very much thanks to Jason from 
[Industrious One](http://industriousone.com/) who found the solution and Quentin
over at [Rogue Amoeba](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/) who mentioned Jason's 
fix to be "very very simple", which in turn pointed me in the right direction :). 

Have a look at their websites and products, both make excellent apps!
Especially if you're into listening to music or work with audio.
