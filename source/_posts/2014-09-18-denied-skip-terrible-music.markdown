The wait is over! No longer do you need to listen to artists you can't stand on Spotify. And even better: you can automatically skip those annoying skits and bonus tracks on otherwise great albums.

Denied for Mac is [now available](http://www.getdenied.com)!

Get your copy through the website or the Mac App Store and enjoy Top 40 playlists, the Christmas season and Spotify radio without the songs that you dislike.

Enjoy and let me know what you think on Twitter: [@deniedapp](https://www.twitter.com/deniedapp).
