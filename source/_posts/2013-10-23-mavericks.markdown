Apple released [OS X version 10.9](https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567) yesterday. It's a free update and I think
most of you will want to upgrade as soon as you get the chance.

All Danger Cove apps have been tested and work with OS X Mavericks. So, don't let 
Porthole, AirVLC, coucou or Reign hold you back and have fun checking out all new 
features Apple's added!
