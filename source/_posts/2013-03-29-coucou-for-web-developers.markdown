If you're a web developer you probably recognize the situation where you're running a local development evironment with MAMP/XAMPP, Rails or Node.js and need/want someone else to see what you're working on. Maybe to do a cross-browser check, maybe just to show how awesome this latest design looks.

To make this happen you'd need to take a few steps:

* find out your IP address, or hostname;
* send it to your friend or colleague;
* your friend/collegue will need to enter it in his browser.

If anything changes (new ip address) or if you want to show your work in progress to even more people, you'll need to repeat the steps above.

With coucou you can be done in just a few simple clicks. Let me walk you through it.

First we need to enable broadcasting in the preferences pane. This setting is saved, so you'll only need to do this once.

<div class="thumbnail">
{% img /images/content/coucou/coucou-preferences2.jpg "Enable broadcasting" %}
<div class="caption">
Enable broadcasting
</div>
</div>

Now follow these steps:

* click the menu bar icon;
* select Broadcast and click New Service...;
* select one of the presets in the window that pops-up or create a service manually;
* click publish and you're set!

<div class="thumbnail">
{% img /images/content/coucou/coucou-newservice.jpg "Add a new service" %}
<div class="caption">
Add a new service
</div>
</div>

<div class="thumbnail">
{% img /images/content/coucou/coucou-rails.jpg "Find a custom service" %}
<div class="caption">
Your service is now visible for anyone using coucou
</div>
</div>
