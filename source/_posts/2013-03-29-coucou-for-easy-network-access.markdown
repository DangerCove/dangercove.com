Macs can broadcast various network services. You've probably used this feature before without knowing about it, when you start a Screen Sharing session or browse some files on a network.

While its already pretty easy to find these services in the Finder, wouldn't it be awesome if you could do this from your menu bar? Or connect to web servers, SSH, printers and even create your own services? We created coucou to make this happen.

Coucou is now available now on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/coucou/id620436774) for $0.99, or â‚¬0.89.
