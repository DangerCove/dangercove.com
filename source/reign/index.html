      <h3>Control Spotify from any device with a browser!</h3>
      <p>Reign lets your control Spotify on your Mac from any device with a web browser. As long as it's on the same network. Go crazy and try these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phones</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Tables</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Other computers</strong></li>
        <li>Playstation Vita</li>
        <li>Playstation 3</li>
        <li>Web enabled TVs</li>
        <li>E-Readers (yes, really)</li>
        <li>Anything else with a browser</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Customize the experience</h3>
      <p>Use themes to personalize your Spotify remote. Select a background image, or completely change the HTML & CSS.</p>
      <p>You can even take it a step further and create a native custom client. Check the <a href="/reign/developers/">developer page</a> for more information.
