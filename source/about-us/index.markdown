Like it says in our sub-title, Danger Cove makes little apps that improve productivity and aim to make your life even more fun. We've been around since oktober of 2011, released a <a href="/">few apps</a>, drank many beers and are continuously on the look-out for new adventures.
Or "app ideas", but we think "adventures" sounds much, much more interesting. We considered "appventures", but decided it was too corny.

All the Danger Cove-ing is done by a single guy, called Boy. You can find him on Twitter [@boyvanamstel](http://twitter.com/boyvanamstel) and he [loves getting email](mailto:ahoy@dangercove.com).

Our office used to be in Rotterdam, right next to the Central Train Station, and was known to sometimes contain spiders and space invaders. We're currently looking for office space in The Hague, which will probably also contain spiders and space invaders.
