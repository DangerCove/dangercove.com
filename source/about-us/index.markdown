Like it says in our sub-title, we're two Dutch guys (<a href="http://twitter.com/bjornvanraaij" target="_blank">Bj√∏rn</a> & <a href="http://twitter.com/boyvanamstel">Boy</a>) who work on apps that make our lives (and hopefully yours too) easier. Danger Cove has been around since oktober of 2011 and during that time we've released a <a href="/">few apps</a>, drank many beers and are continuously on the look-out for new adventures.

Or "app ideas", but we think "adventures" sounds much, much more interesting. We considered "appventures", but decided it was too corny.

Our office is based in Rotterdam, right next to the Central Train Station, and has been known to sometimes contain spiders and space invaders.
