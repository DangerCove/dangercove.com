__This issue has been resolved. Update Porthole to restore compatibility. Read the [follow up](/blog/2013/09/26/update-porthole-to-restore-apple-tv-compatibility/) for more details.__

The latest Apple TV firmware (version 6.0) adds a new layer of mandatory encryption for audio playback that wasn't required before. This currently prevents unofficial audio based AirPlay apps to work like they used to.

<!-- more -->

I'm looking into the issue and trying to figure out a solution, if there is one. This requires some research and it might take a while to find a way around the encryption.

__The best thing to do at the moment, is to not update your Apple TV to the latest version if you want to stream to it using Porthole__. To stay up to date, follow [@getporthole](http://twitter.com/getporthole) on Twitter. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Note that Apple TV's running 5.3 or below and other AirPlay speakers are unaffected.
