I'm proud and excited to announce that [Timeless is now available through Setapp](https://go.setapp.com/stp276?refAppID=387)! ðŸ¥³

Setapp is an award winning service that offers unlimited access to a curated list of 170+ high quality Mac apps for just $9.99 a month. You can use tools like Bartender, CleanMyMac, Dropzone, iStat Menus, IconJar, Ulysses, _Timeless (of course)_ and many more with one easy subscription.

If you're a designer, programmer or another type of professional, you'll appreciate the convenience and power that comes with having access to such a wide range of software.

I've been a longtime fan of Setapp and its collection of Mac gems ðŸ’Ž. It's a great way to use Timeless and adds another path besides the [direct download](/timeless/download) and [Mac App Store](/timeless/appstore) through which you can keep your eyes of the clock and stay focused while getting work done.
