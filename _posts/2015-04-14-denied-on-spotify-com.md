description: Denied is being featured on Spotify's developer showcase!

I'm super proud to say that Denied is featured on [Spotify's Developer Showcast](https://developer.spotify.com/showcase/). Which means there's this cool page that lists a few apps that use Spotify's developer interface and [DENIED IS ON IT](https://developer.spotify.com/showcase/item/denied-skip-terrible-music/)!

The developer showcast highlights apps that use one or more of Spotify's methods to control the desktop app or retrieve information from their immense song database. Denied uses AppleScript to control the OS X desktop app and uses the database to check for songs that contain explicit lyrics.
