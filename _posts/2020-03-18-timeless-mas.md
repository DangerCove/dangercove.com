Timeless is now also available on the Mac App Store! It's the exact same release you get from [download it directly from me](/timeless).

An in-app purchase unlocks the premium features. üîê

### v2020.6

With the new download option also comes an update for the non-MAS release. It contains mostly under the hood changes to accommodate the App Store release.
