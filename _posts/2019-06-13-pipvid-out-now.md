With [Pipvid](/pipvid) both VLC and QuickTime gain a picture-in-picture mode. Ideal for watching videos in the corner of your screen while you work on something else.

Pipvid automatically enables float-on-top for the player window and can optionally ensure the window video remains visible on every Space. The window snaps to any corner, of any screen attached to your Mac.

You can try Pipvid for free for 10 minutes at a time. Once you're convinced, you can [purchase a license](/pipvid/buy) through Gumroad.
