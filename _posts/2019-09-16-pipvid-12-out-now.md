[Pipvid](/pipvid) version 1.2 is now [available for download](/pipvid/download). You can also get it by checking for updates in the app.

The update contains some bug fixes and a rewritten license window. I've actually ported over the new license window from [Timeless](/timeless) to Pipvid, making it easier to share updates across all my apps.

Want to try the new license window? [Buy Pipvid today](/pipvid/buy). ðŸ˜‰
