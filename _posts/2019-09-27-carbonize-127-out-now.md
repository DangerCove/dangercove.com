[Carbonize](/carbonize) version 1.2.7 is now [available for download](/carbonize/appstore).

The update contains a fix for the update [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh) shipped earlier this week. In the update they moved a button, which in turn made Carbonize hide the wrong interface element. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this caused.

To prevent this issue in the future, I'd like to ship an offline version of the underlying Carbon editor with Carbonize. This would allow you to use Carbonize fully offline _and_ make sure an update to the Carbon website won't break Carbonize.

I'm close to getting this to work, but it's not quite ready yet. ðŸ¤ž
