Pipvid v1.1 was just released! ðŸš€

![A screenshot Pipvid's preferences screen, showing the size based options](/assets/img/app/pipvid-preferences.png)

This update adds a brand new feature: it allows you to specify the maximum window size up to which Pipvid should manage it.

Using this setting means you can keep Pipvid turned on, use the player window as normal when it takes up a certain part of the screen, then shrink it down and Pipvid will automatically snap it into the corner. It's size based automatic picture-on-picture mode. ðŸ‘Œ
