Version 1.0.0 is now available [via the Mac App Store](/denied/appstore)!

Starting today, bands you can't stand will no longer annoy you while listening to Spotify. With Denied you can:

- Skip songs by artist, title or album.
- Specify match criteria: starts with, ends with, contains or equals to.
- Optionally show notifications when a song is skipped.
- Keep track of how often a rule is used.
- Quickly suppress rules or temporarily stop skipping entirely.

If you're a member of the press, have a look at the [Press Kit](/denied/presskit) and official [Press Release](/news/2014/09/18/press-release).
