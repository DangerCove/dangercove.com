Apple released [OS X version 10.10](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082) yesterday. It's a free update and I think most of you will want to upgrade as soon as you get the chance.

All Danger Cove apps have been tested and work beautifully with OS X Yosemite. So, don't let [Denied](http://www.getdenied.com), [Porthole](http://www.getporthole.com), [AirVLC](/airvlc), [coucou](/coucou) or [Reign](reign) hold you back and have fun checking out all new features Apple has added!
