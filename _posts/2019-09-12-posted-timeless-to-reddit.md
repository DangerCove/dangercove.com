_I posted Timeless to [the Productivity sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/d254pg/working_on_timeless_an_app_to_reduce_time_anxiety/) the other day to gather feedback. The entire post is included below. If you'd like to provide feedback on my tool to reduce time anxiety I encourage you to chime in, use the built-in feedback dialog in the beta or [contact me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/boyvanamstel)._

Hi there, I've been working on Timeless, an app to reduce the Time Anxiety I've been experiencing. For me, it manifests like this:

* __10.00__ _"Only 10 am?? It feels like Iâ€™ve been doing nothing."_
* __11.30__ _"Better not start something new, itâ€™ll be lunch soon."_
* __14.00__ _"Sheesh this day is never going to endâ€¦"_
* __16.00__ _"Itâ€™s already 4 pm?? I did nothing today and itâ€™s too late to start now."_

Six months ago I disabled the clock in the top right corner of my screen on my Mac. That worked wonders, but made it hard to stay grounded and remember mundane stuff like getting up to grab lunch. ðŸ˜…

That's when I created the small menu bar application that I'd like your feedback on. It's currently available for free as a beta on [usetimeless.app](/timeless).

It works by setting time ranges that are then indicated in the corner of your screen instead of an actual clock. This means that when it's 9.45am you might see a range that shows that it's between 8am and 12pm. For me this reduces the mental burden some hours of the day give me, while still allowing me to naturally get through the day without feeling like a robot and setting tons of reminders. (I still set reminders for important events.)

I think it's great, but I'd love for more people to try this approach and let me know what they think. I'm curious to find out if this is something that can be applied universally, and if there are features missing. In the last update for example, I added the option to only show the indicator on certain (work) days and just show the time when the indicator is idle.

Let me know what you think!

_(The app is currently only available for macOS. I'll start on a Windows version when I've gathered enough feedback. If you're on Windows and still would like to help, disabling your clock and letting me know how it affects your day is very useful information to me!)_
