If you're anything like me, you spend quite some time reading, listening to and
watching various things online. It would be impossible to organize all this
information without the use of a few excellent apps, like Reeder for news 
and Instacast for podcasts.

Web videos are harder to manage. Despite popular believe, not everything is
available on YouTube or Vimeo. In need of a dedicated tool to keep up with online videos,
no matter where they're hosted, I've made a brand new app!

Tapetrap will give you instant access to your favorite webisodes, lets you know when 
a new item comes out and keeps track of which you've seen. 

For me, this means I can watch VICE, Zero Punctuation, the AVGN, Conan's 
Clueless Gamer, the Spoony Experiment, Gamekings, Christopher Walkenthrough, TED talks and Uitzending 
Gemist all in one app.

It's been in development for the past month and, not too tease you too much, is
working great! That said, it's not done yet. I still want to polish a 
few features before putting out a public version. Until then, [subscribe to the mailing list](/tapetrap/) 
to stay up to date and help testing!
