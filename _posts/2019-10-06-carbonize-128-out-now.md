The team behind [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) has been [acquired](https://dawnlabs.io/fossa-acquires-dawnlabs) by FOSSA a few days ago. That's great news for them and for Carbon!

It also means that updates to the web based tool are coming out even fast than before. Most just add features to [Carbonize](/carbonize), some alter the UI and require an update from my end.

I've released version 1.2.8 a few days ago to commodate the changes Carbon made in version 4.3.0. It's now [available for download](/carbonize/appstore) from the Mac App Store. Enjoy!
