After using Timeless myself for weeks and tweaking the experience, it's finally time to share the first beta version with you. I'm very excited about this. [Try Timeless now](/timeless/beta).

Hiding the clock from the corner of my eye and switching to the less specific indicator of Timeless has allowed me to be more productive while reducing anxiety. I'm curious to hear if it does the same for you.
