In the latest update Carbonize gets a pretty significant graphical overhaul. With the new toolbar comes a dedicated Export button that allows you to choose between exporting through the Floating Windows you're familiar with, or a standard Save Panel.

I've also added a Share button that allows you to quickly import the images in apps that you use often.

Finally, there's a new Release Notes window that will update you on all the changes that were made. It's shown the first time you launch an update.

You can [get the update from the Mac App Store](/carbonize/appstore).
