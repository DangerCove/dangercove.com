If you're a web developer you probably recognize that moment where you're running a local development evironment with MAMP/XAMPP, Rails or Node.js and need to see your site on another computer, or show someone else what you're working on. Maybe to do a cross-browser check, maybe just to show how awesome this latest design looks.

This usually involves copy-pasting of ip addresses, emailing and other such nonsense. With coucou this can be done in just a few simple clicks. Let me walk you through it.

First we need to enable broadcasting in the preferences pane.

*Enable broadcasting*

Now follow these steps:

<!-- more -->

* click the menu bar icon;
* select Broadcast and click New Service...;
* select one of the presets in the window that pops-up or create a service manually;
* click publish and you're set!

*Add a new service*

*Your service is now visible for anyone using coucou, or any other Bonjour compatible app*

You can unpublish the service by clicking the corresponding entry in the Broadcast menu.
