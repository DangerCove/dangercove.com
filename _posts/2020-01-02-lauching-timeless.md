The start of the new year is a great time to begin reducing stress and consider potential distractions. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m delighted to announce Iâ€™m launching my time anxiety reducing Mac app called Timeless today!

Timeless replaces the standard clock with a more subtle time indicator. Itâ€™s been tested for months, got encouraging comments  [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/d254pg/working_on_timeless_an_app_to_reduce_time_anxiety/) Â and the beta was even featured in FastCompanyâ€™sÂ  [â€˜best new apps of 2019â€™](https://www.fastcompany.com/90443104/the-25-best-new-apps-of-2019) .

The clock can be a distraction for me. It imposes stress and distracts me while I try to get work done and sometimes even when Iâ€™m trying to relax.

If youâ€™re anything like me, these will sound familiar:
* **10.00** _"Only 10 am?? It feels like Iâ€™ve been doing nothing."_
* **11.30** _"Better not start something new, itâ€™ll be lunch soon."_
* **14.00** _"Sheesh this day is never going to endâ€¦"_
* **16.00** _"Itâ€™s already 4 pm?? I did nothing today and itâ€™s too late to start now."_

Timeless been in my menu bar since I created the first, rough version and I canâ€™t imagine not using it anymore.

Used in conjunction with reminders and my calendar, it keeps me from glancing at the clock whenever Iâ€™m at my Mac. For me, thatâ€™s a huge stress reducer and Iâ€™d love to know if it works for you too. ðŸ˜Š
