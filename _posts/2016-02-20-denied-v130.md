An update was long overdue and the Spotify album art issue was really getting on my nerves. So, here it is: Denied version 1.3.0!

* Denied displays Spotify album art again!
* Instead of just using the slider, you can now enter the amount of days Denied should remember Repeating Songs.
* Updated the update framework.
* Brought the rest of the project into 2016 ;).
* Bugs were fixed, performance was tweaked.

The update is live on the Mac App Store.
