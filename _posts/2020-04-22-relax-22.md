I've expanded a feature in [Relax](/relax)! Instead of only kicking into action when the default output switches to the built-in speaker, you can now choose to pause Spotify, Music and/or iTunes when the default audio output changes to _any_ sound device. ðŸ¥³

This is a great update for when you leave your Mac connected to external speakers, but don't want to miss a second of your favorite music or podcast when you disconnect your headphones. ðŸŽ§

You can [get it on the Mac App Store](/relax/appstore)!
