Instead of focusing on songs I detest, let's talk about some that I love; totally compensating for all the negativity on this site.

I've made my [starred playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/boyvanamstel/starred) public so you can browse through tracks I've saved. I also religiously 'scrobble plays' to my [Last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/boyvanamstel). Do you guys still do that? If not, I highly recommend it. Browsing through the 90.000+ tracks I've listened to over the years feels like an incredible trip down memory lane. Plus it allows me to compare my musical taste to [Japie](http://www.hiplikejapie.nl).

Upon analyzing my Starred playlist, it seems to be a combination of all-time favorites and spur of the moment stuff that sounded perfect at the right time. An example from the first category would be Glycerine by Bush. It's become sort of a ritual to put it on when I'm testing one of my other apps, called [Porthole](http://www.getporthole.com). Your Love by The Outfield I also never get tired of hearing.

Last.fm indicates that I also listen to an ungodly amount of Punk.

More recently I've been listening to a lot of Chiptune and Synth Pop. I tend to alternate between periods of listening to guitar music and electronic tunes. Computerized songs seem to be winning at the moment &mdash; although I thoroughly enjoyed that Black Label Society concert last Saturday!

I'm always on the lookout for new awesome music to listen to, so I'd love to hear about your Starred playlists on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/deniedapp).
