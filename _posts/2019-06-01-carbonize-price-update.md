Like Denied and Relax in [the previous update](/news/adjusting-prices/), Carbonize will be a paid-upfront app from now on. My top priority is making sure my business becomes sustainable (again). A constant revenue stream means I get to work on updates and release new apps. Denied and Relax seem to do a little better right now, adding Carbonize to the list feels obvious.

To smooth over the transition you can **[get Carbonize](/carbonize/appstore) at a 50% discount** until June 8th.

I'm not there yet though, so I'm leaving the option to donate intact. If you got Carbonize before the price update, maybe have an extra look at the Tip Jar. It's much appreciated. ðŸ™‚

Feel free to reach out to me [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/boyvanamstel) if you have any questions, or just to say hi.
