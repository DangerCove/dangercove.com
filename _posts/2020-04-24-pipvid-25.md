[Pipvid](/pipvid) v2020.2 adds a _Global Keyboard Shortcut_ ‚å®Ô∏è that allows you to toggle it off and on with the press of a button!

This makes is very easy to switch VLC and QuickTime in and out of PiP-mode. It litteraly takes less than a second.

It's not as sophisticated or innovative as the resize trigger, but it's so convenient. It's made me use Pipvid even more. üëå

You can [get Pipvid on Gumroad](/pipvid/get)!
