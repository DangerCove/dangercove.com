I'm trying something new to support the development of my apps. Instead of charging upfront, Denied is now free with optional in-app purchases.

This puts a lot of trust in you, my customer. I rely on your generosity to generate enough revenue to continue working on my software. It's a little scary, I have to say.

That said, I'm very excited about lowering the bar to use my apps. There's nothing stopping you anymore from recommending Denied to others and for them to install it on their Macs.

If you've purchased Denied before, that's marvelous. Your support has kept me working on Denied since 2014! I'm hoping you're with me for this next chapter. ðŸ¤Ÿ

Don't have Denied yet? [Get Denied](/denied/appstore)!
