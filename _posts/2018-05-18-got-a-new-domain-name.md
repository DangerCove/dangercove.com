description: I registered denied.app. It's glorious.

Google recently announced it would start selling *.app* domain names. Of course I couldn't pass up the opportunity to register *denied.app*.

I like it so much that I've changed it to be the default. So, if you tell your friends to check out Denied, you can just direct them to Denied dot app. ðŸ‘Œ
