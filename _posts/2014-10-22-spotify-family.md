description: Spotify's new Family subscription makes it even more affordable to listen to music with your family.

I know quite a few people who share a single premium Spotify account with their partner/kids/dogs/cats so they don't have to spend the $10/&euro;10 a month extra per account. The drawback is that only one user/pet can use the account at the time; so if you're blasting Queen and Azrael wants to listen to some Snoop Lion, you're out of luck and will get cut off.

Spotify has come up with a solution for this, called Family, and it's pretty great.

Instead of paying the full price for each user, Family comes with a discount for each extra user you connect. This means that instead of having to cough up $50 for five users, you'll be charged only $35,99.

* Spotify Family 2: $17.99
* Spotify Family 3: $23.99
* Spotify Family 4: $29.99
* Spotify Family 5: $35.99

The even better part is that each user will have their own account, with their own preferences and favorites. A wonderful reason to stop the game of musical chairs and get everyone an account of their own.
