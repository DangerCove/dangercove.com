The last time [I posted about Denied](/news/denied-is-now-free/), I introduced the Tip Jar and announced the app would become Free. My goal was to try and see if I could reach more people by lowering the bar of entry and in turn increase revenue by convincing a significant amount of those people to voluntarily pay through the Tip Jar.

We're about six months into the experiment and unfortunately this hasn't happened. Revenue has decreased. This means I need to try something different to reach my goal of achieving a sustainable income from my apps.

In the coming week I'll change [Denied](/denied) and [Relax](/relax) (back) from Free to Paid Upfront apps, leaving the Tip Jars intact. I've also released updates for all my apps to include a new, more personal tipping screen that will hopefully give you a better picture of who you're supporting by donating. ðŸ˜Š

![A screenshot of the new Tip Jar, showing a picture of me, text explaining why donations are most welcome and three donation options: a cookie, coffee or a sandwich](/assets/img/news/carbonize-tipjar-v2.png)

If you got the app before the price change, everything will remain the same. I hope this does motivate you to have another look at the Tip Jar and help me, help you get some great updates and new apps. ðŸ’ª
