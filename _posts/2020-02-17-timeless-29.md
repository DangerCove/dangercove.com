A new version of Timeless came out this Friday! Besides a whole bunch of under-the-hood tweaks and improvements it introduces two new features that were requested by a few of you.

I've also switched to [a more liberal versioning system](https://blog.curtisherbert.com/slopes-diaries-21-versionless/). This is update came out in 2020 (**2020**.3) and it's update number three (2020.**3**) this year. In a more traditional versioning system I might've called this is 1.5 or even 2.0 release. üöÄ

## New features

Let's start with the new features. They were both requested several times and I think they're great additions.

Both are premium features that will be unlocked when you [buy a license for Timeless](/timeless/buy).

### Connect the last and first time entry

This is a feature for night owls. Previously Timeless would create a range up to the last time entry, then turn idle until the first time entry the next morning. This won't do if you're getting something done between 10 PM and 3 AM. I'm excited to say that with version 2020.3 you can choose to bridge the gap between two consecutive, enabled days.

Simply enable the feature in the indicator preferences. That's it. ‚úì

### Customize the optional clock's date components

Originally Timeless would always show the current day and time when the indicator is idle. If it's Friday at 20:15, it would say "_Mon 20:15_". The new default is to just show the time, clean and simple "_20:15_". You can optionally add the current day and even display the full date "_Mon 17 Feb 20:15_", exactly like how macOS allows you to do.

All date and time formats are of course displayed according to your current locale. üåê

## Changes

* The optional clock now has its own preference pane.
* Toggling a premium feature shows the registration window as a convenient sheet.
* A single internal timer makes sure all events happen at the right time.
* Toggling weekdays is now a premium feature. If you were using the free version, your current settings are preserved.

### Fixes

* The alignment of the time in the menu bar has been fixed for macOS 10.15.
* Lots of under the hood changes and improvements regarding the internal clock handling UI updates, waking from sleep etc.

That's it. A lot has changed in this release. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, click the '[Timeless Help](https://apps.dangr.co/com.dangercove.Timeless.Mac/support)' item and let me know.

Enjoy the update! üôÇ
