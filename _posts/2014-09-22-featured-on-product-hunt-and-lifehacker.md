This is so cool! Denied is [currently being featured on Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com/posts/denied) and has [an article on Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/denied-automatically-skips-music-you-dont-like-in-spoti-1637540911)!

Denied actually stayed in the top 5 products on the Product Hunt homepage for most of the day, gathering 85 upvotes in total and increasing the amount of downloads quite a bit. I'm even more content with the comments that were added.

[Marc KÃ¶hlbrugge](https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge), who has been running Denied since it appeared on [Beta List](http://betalist.com/startups/denied), said this:

> Been using this for a while now. I listen to a lot of hiphop which often contains [skits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_skit) which can be a little annoying at times. Denied makes it super easy to automatically skip them.

Super smart. I've also heard people using Denied to skip live-sessions in the same way. If you have figured out other clever ways to make Denied do great things, [let me know](https://www.twitter.com/deniedapp)!
