After trying Timeless, Denied, Carbonize, Relax and Pipvid with the first macOS 11 beta, I've discovered they're all working fine!

New releases tend to introduce (security) features that I need to comply with, but the first beta at least seems to be fully compatible. üëç

Here's a screenshot of the apps running on the new OS. Notice the huge change in design.

I stick to default UI elements for most of my apps in anticipation of an event like this; every app immediately looks right at home with the new look. Apart for Denied, which could use with some rounded corners. üòÖ
