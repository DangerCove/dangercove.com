description: A new Denied update is in the works. This is what I'm working on.

A new update for Denied is in the works and I'd like to share a few of the features I'm about to add. Read the full article to see what's coming in the near future.

The way Denied works, is that it picks up when Spotify, Rdio or iTunes change to a different song and then it puts that new track past a list of mechanisms - which I've labeled 'judges'. The current version only has the 'Rules Judge' in place, who makes sure songs that match any of the user defined rules don't get any airtime. In the upcoming update, Rules Judge gets some company.

I hate listening to the same song twice. Unless it's my favorite song that day, then I can listen to it all the time on repeat. Anyway, some of Spotify's (Artist) Radios have a limited supply of songs and you'll notice the same song playing three or four times a day. The new 'Originality Judge' will put an end to this. It checks if a song was played before in the past x hours and will skip tracks that aren't original enough.

The 'Explicit Content Judge' has been requested quite a few times and I'm happy to say he's on schedule to make his appearance in the next update as well. Trying to play most Hip Hop and Rap playlists and a few of my favorite Eminem tracks is impossible when he's on duty. Any song that's labeled explicit will be skipped automatically.

Keep an eye out for more news and maybe a due date for this update. In the meantime, are there any judges that you'd like to see? <a href="mailto:{{ site.contact.email }}">Let me know</a>!
