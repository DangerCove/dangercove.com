Carbonize v1.1 introduces a new rendering method that greatly reduces export time and improves compatibility with features available on [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh).

* You can now instantly export images, even when you're offline.
* Custom themes are fully supported,
* as are image backgrounds.
* Emoji work as expected.

You can [get the update from the Mac App Store](/carbonize/appstore).
