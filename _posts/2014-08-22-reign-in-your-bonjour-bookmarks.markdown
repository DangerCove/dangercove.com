A new version of Reign just came out. Yes, really. And it even has a few cool new features (not a new theme though, sorry). I want talk one of them here: having Reign show up in Safari's Bonjour Bookmarks or Favorites.

There's a magic menu in Safari, disabled per default, that will automatically show websites that announce themselves over [Bonjour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software). Bonjour is basically "a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and hostname resolution". In short: it will let your Reign server show up in anyone's Safari, without needing to install Reign! Here's how to set it up.
