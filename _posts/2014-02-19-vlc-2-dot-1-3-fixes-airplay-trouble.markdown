In the first two releases of VLC 2.1.x, AirPlay wasn't working like it's supposed to. I even [recommended](/blog/2013/11/13/airvlc-v-dot-1-1-dot-1/) to stay on 2.0.8 if you wanted to use [AirVLC](/airvlc).

With the recent release of version 2.1.3 all problems seem to have been fixed and AirVLC is compatible out of the box! You can update VLC from within the app, or [through their website](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/).
