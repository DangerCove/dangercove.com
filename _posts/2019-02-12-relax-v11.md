Relax version 1.1 is out now. I've added support for pausing after your computer wakes from sleep.

I've also changed Relax' muting-after-enabling behavior a bit:

Previously only starting Relax while it wasn't running would trigger the mute-at-startup sequence. Now disabling and the re-enabling Relax will also mute the built-in speakers and pause any players. This should prevent even more awkward moments where you thought your speakers where muted while they actually weren't. ðŸ‘Œ

Update in the app, through the Mac App Store or [get Relax today](/relax)!
