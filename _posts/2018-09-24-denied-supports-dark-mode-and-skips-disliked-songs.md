description: I released an update that introduces Dark Mode and skipping disliked songs for Denied.
---

Apple has released [the latest version of macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/mojave/) to the public. The prominent new feature Mojave introduces is a new graphical theme, that Apple has dubbed Dark Mode. It's a gorgeous, rough, yet elegant way to present the operating system you're familiar with. Apps that customize their interface to take full advantage of Dark Mode look right at home and feel great to use. 

I'm very proud to say that Denied supports Dark Mode from day one.

While updating the color palette I took the opportunity to re-evaluate all the buttons, switches and other interface elements. Denied was released in 2014 and with this release it's more than ready for 2018 and beyond. You'll notice that it looks stunning in a lighter theme and on previous versions of macOS as well.

## Skipping disliked songs

This has been a much requested feature and I'm happy to say that it's finally here. iTunes and Apple Music allow us to mark specific songs as disliked. It's a quick and easy way to let iTunes know that you don't want to hear a specific track. You'll be surprised to learn that this doesn't actually prevent iTunes from playing these songs, though.

With the latest update of Denied this can been corrected. If enabled, Denied will will automatically skip over songs being played on iTunes or Apple Music if they're disliked.

A similar feature exists in Spotify, but the property isn't accessible to third-party applications (like Denied). I'm regularly checking if this changes.

## Skipping explicit songs updated

I've switched to a new way of checking songs for explicit content. This updated method should be more reliable with more people using Denied every day. I tested it thoroughly and didn't notice any downsides. 

If you do pick up on a negative (or positive!) change in how Denied handles explicit tracks, [send me a message](/support).

## Get version 1.5 now

I'm pretty stoked about this update and I think you'll be too. [Get version 1.5 in the App Store](/appstore) and consider leaving a five star review while you're there. Reviews are immensely helpful in getting more people to notice Denied, plus it'll make my day.
