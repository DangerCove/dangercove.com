description: Spotify is planning an update will support playing through Sonos speakers.

Sonos came out with some interesting news today: they've partnered with Spotify to enable control over Sonos speakers directly from Spotify's mobile and desktop apps.

For Denied, this is great news as the official Sonos app is not supported and horrendous songs can reign freely over anyone using a Sonos setup. This future updates should put and end to that.

It's not entirely clear when you can expect this option to land in Spotify's apps, only that it will be in beta this October.
