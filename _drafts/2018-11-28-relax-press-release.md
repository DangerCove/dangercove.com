Utrecht, The Netherlands — November 28th 2018 — Danger Cove today released Relax for Mac. Relax automatically mutes your internal speakers and pauses music apps when you disconnect headphones.

Disconnecting your headphones or speakers from your Mac automatically selects the Internal Speakers. Any sound that was playing before is now shared with everyone around you. Relax monitors your default audio output and takes action when it notices you switch back to your internal speakers. Whether it's dead batteries, wired or wireless.
