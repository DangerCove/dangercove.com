My goal was to keep a video running while working on other tasks simultaneously:

* Play a tutorial video while you work on the example project.
* Transcribe an interview.
* Simply enjoy your favorite series while you browse the internet.

I missed the feature in VLC and decided to 'bolt it on' the popular video app.

## Video

<iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNGKXOv4PBU?modestbranding=1&rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%"></iframe>


## Key features

You could add a keyboard shortcut to toggle PiP-mode off and on with the press of a button.

Besides the keyboard shortcut, you could pull VLC and QuickTime in and out of Picture-in-Picture mode by resizing their player window.

This means you could use VLC and QuickTime like normal when the window takes up a bigger part of the screen and then automatically switch into picture-in-picture mode when you shrink the window down.

## Why it's been discontinued

Eventually attention dropped, probably in favor of apps like [IINA](https://iina.io) which support PiP out of the box.
