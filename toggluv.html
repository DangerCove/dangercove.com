I made Toggluv to quickly log hours into [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com). After years of using thebeta version myself, I never really got to finishing the product. 

Toggl's iOS app has a pretty great 'calendar input view' that allows me to easily log my hours without having a timer running. That's basically what I wanted to do with Toggluv. I highly recommend giving their app a try.
