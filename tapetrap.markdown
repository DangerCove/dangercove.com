  If youâ€™re anything like me, you watch online videos on dozens of different websites. I want to keep up with new content and easily browse clips from any site with a feed.

Tapetrap was my vision of how watching web videos should work and the beta version actually worked very well for me.

However, while RSS is perfect for written sources, video sites don't always offer them. With some sites even deliberately removing the feeds entirely to promote their own methods to keep track of the videos you've seen and watching them at another time. This usually requires an account. For each site..

Until I figure out a more reliable way of getting content into the app, I've decided to stop development.
