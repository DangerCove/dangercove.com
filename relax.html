          <h2 class="title is-2">Mutes automatically</h2>
          <p>Disconnecting your headphones or speakers from your Mac automatically selects the Internal Speakers. Any sound that was playing before is now shared with everyone around you.</p>
          <p>Your Cyndi Lauper playlist? Yea, that's no longer a secret.</p>
          <h3 class="title is-3">Rely on Relax</h3>
          <p>It monitors your default audio output and takes action when it notices you switch back to your internal speakers. Whether it's dead batteries, wired or wireless.</p>

          <h2 class="title is-2">Sits in the menu bar</h2>
          <p>Relax is a small menu bar application that's tucked away at the top of your screen in your menu bar.</p>
          <p>It's not in your way, but never out of reach.</p>
          <h3 class="title is-3">Just what you need</h3>
          <p>Relax focusses just on your internal speakers. If you change back to your comfortable headphones, or Bluetooth speaker Relax does nothing and lets you easily switch to a private listening session.</p>
          <p>It's just when you switch back to your Mac's output that the sound gets cut and the supported players are paused.</p>

          <p>Besides muting the volume, Relax can pause playback with Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music and VLC.</p>
          <p>Instead of pausing players only when switching to the built-in speaker, you can choose to <em>always</em> pause players when the default audio output changes. Don't miss a second of your favorite song or podcast ever again!</p>
