    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm writing this from my studio in The Hague. It's been quite an adventure from
when Danger Cove started October first 2011. An expedition that delivered <a href="http://www.dangercove.com">four
released apps</a>, one in progress (more on that in a
future post) and a whole bunch of projects that looked cool at first, but now live in a folder called "shelved" ;).</p>

<p>It feels awesome that Danger Cove apps are being used by more people than I could
hope for. Thanks so much to the wonderful people that took the time to spread
the word about them. I appreciate it a lot.</p>

<p>To celebrate, both <a href="http://www.getporthole.com">Porthole</a> and
<a href="http://www.dangercove.com/airvlc">AirVLC</a> are 40% off today! I assume you
already got that from the header image though. The offer will end October
2nd at 12pm CET.</p>
