    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you're anything like me, you spend quite some time reading, listening to and
watching various things online. It would be impossible to organize all this
information without the use of a few excellent apps, like Reeder for news
and Instacast for podcasts.</p>

<p>Web videos are harder to manage. Despite popular believe, not everything is
available on YouTube or Vimeo. In need of a dedicated tool to keep up with online videos,
no matter where they're hosted, I've made a brand new app!</p>

</a>
</div>


<p>Tapetrap will give you instant access to your favorite webisodes, lets you know when
a new item comes out and keeps track of which you've seen.</p>

<p>For me, this means I can watch VICE, Zero Punctuation, the AVGN, Conan's
Clueless Gamer, the Spoony Experiment, Gamekings, Christopher Walkenthrough, TED talks and Uitzending
Gemist all in one app.</p>

<p>It's been in development for the past month and, not too tease you too much, is
working great! That said, it's not done yet. I still want to polish a
few features before putting out a public version. Until then, <a href="/tapetrap/">subscribe to the mailing list</a>
to stay up to date and help testing!</p>
