    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/content/denied-macbook-now-playing-with-caption.jpg" alt="Add songs from the Now Playing info" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.getdenied.com">Denied version 1.2.1</a> is out today, but last month I shipped a major update that I haven't posted about on here. It introduces awesome new features and a radical new design. Here's a short list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skipping songs that contain explicit lyrics.</li>
<li>Skipping songs that youâ€™ve heard before in the past few hours.</li>
<li>Seeing which song is currently playing and..</li>
<li>Adding rules straight from the Now Playing information.</li>
</ul>


<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>The rules adding/editing interface has been completely revised.</li>
<li>Cool animations have been added.</li>
<li>Bugs have been fixed and things tweaked.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best animation is probably the one you'll never see. It happens when you pause or un-pause your music player.</p>

<p><img src="/images/content/denied-animation-experiment.gif" alt="Animations in the latest build of Denied" /></p>

<p>The gif above also shows the flow of adding a new rule based on the song that's currently playing. The final version shows the amount of rules you've setup. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>Skipping repeating songs and tracks that contains explicit content are the two major new features. Both are disabled by default, but introduce powerful new methods to passively skip over music you don't want to hear.</p>

</div>


<p>With the repeating song feature, you can set a timeout (between 30 minutes and 24 hours) and Denied will automatically skip over songs that have been played before in the set amount of time. I love this option when I listen to some Spotify Radio stations that have a limited amount of tracks.</p>

<p>The explicit content filter checks if songs are labeled as containing explicit lyrics. If you're listening with kids, or other sensitive ears, this feature will surely come in handy. Note that while it works with Spotify, Rdio and iTunes, the song has to be available in Spotify's library and you need to be connected to the internet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new version of Reign just came out. Yes, really. And it even has a few cool new features (not a new theme though, sorry). I want talk one of them here: having Reign show up in Safari's Bonjour Bookmarks or Favorites.</p>

<div class="thumbnail">

<p>There's a magic menu in Safari, disabled per default, that will automatically show websites that announce themselves over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software">Bonjour</a>. Bonjour is basically "a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and hostname resolution". In short: it will let your Reign server show up in anyone's Safari, without needing to install Reign! Here's how to set it up.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Porthole version 1.7.0 came out two days ago. It introduces scripting, a feature that's been requested more than once.</p>

<p>Being able to use AppleScript to control Porthole means that you can automate and toggle certain functions of Porthole without going through the interface. Which is pretty awesome!</p>

<p>Update to the latest version from within the app, or <a href="http://www.getporthole.com/download">download</a> a fresh copy from the website. Then read <a href="http://www.getporthole.com/scripting">the tutorial on scripting</a> to get started.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[So much (volume) control]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.dangercove.com/blog/2014/04/02/so-much-volume-control/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-02T10:17:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dangercove.com/blog/2014/04/02/so-much-volume-control</id>

<a href="http://www.getporthole.com"><img src="/images/content/porthole-volumecontrol.jpg" title="Porthole Volume Control" alt="Porthole Volume Control"></a>
</div>


<p>Porthole's main volume control has always been the buttons on the keyboard. Pressing F10 will mute everything, F11 lowers it and F12 turns it up. Just as you'd expect when looking at the little icons on the keys, really.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sometimes this isn't enough. Looking at the amount of votes this got on the <a href="http://porthole.uservoice.com/forums/151703-general/suggestions/3661146-adjust-airplay-devices-audio-levels-individually">suggestion page</a>, for quite a few people this wasn't enough. If you have a great deal of speakers around your home (or one that's particularly obnoxious, volume wise) being able to set a specific volume becomes important.</p>

<p>This posed a design challenge, more than a technical one. I frankly didn't feel comfortable adding an undetermined number of sliders to the interface. Porthole's main focus has always been elegance and ease of use. That doesn't mix well with a row of sliders, trust me. Also, I didn't want to give up the use of the volume keys.</p>

<p>After some consideration and tests, I came up with something that works. There are sliders, but they aren't in the main interface and they control the volume, but not in a way that conflicts with the volume keys. Instead of setting the volume absolutely, the sliders determine an offset, that's why you can set a negative number.</p>

<p>In practice, this works as follows: Say the main volume is at 5, one speaker has a -2 offset, the other +4. This means the absolute volume for speaker one is 3 and for the other 9. Pressing the volume keys to turn up the volume by 1, sets the speakers to 4 and 10 respectively.</p>

<p>This might take a bit to get used to, but I've found it works very very well. Especially because all volume preferences are saved per speaker.</p>

<p>Want to take this for a spin? Just <a href="http://www.getporthole.com/download">download version 1.6.0 or higher</a>!</p>
